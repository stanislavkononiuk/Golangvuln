description: |
  Due to a goroutine deadlock, using github.com/containers/storage/pkg/archive.DecompressStream
  on a xz archive returns a reader which will hang indefinitely when Close is called. An attacker
  can use this to cause denial of service if they are able to cause the caller to attempt to
  decompress an archive they control.
