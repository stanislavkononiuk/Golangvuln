description: |
  On 32-bit platforms an attacker can manipulate a ciphertext encrypted with AES-CBC
  with HMAC such that they can control how large the input buffer is when computing
  the HMAC authentication tag. This can can allow a manipulated ciphertext to be
  verified as authentic, opening the door for padding oracle attacks.
