# The Go Vulnerability Database `golang.org/x/vulndb`

This repository is a prototype of the Go Vulnerability Database.
Read [the Draft Design](https://golang.org/design/draft-vulndb).

Neither the code, nor the data, nor the existence of this repository is to be
considered stable until an approved proposal.

**Important**: vulnerability entries in this repository are represented in an
internal, unstable format that can and will change without notice. The database
will also be available in an interoperable, stable JSON format soon.

## Packages

Some of these packages can probably be coalesced, but for now are easier to work
on in a more segmented fashion.

* `report` provides a package for parsing and linting TOML reports
* `osv` provides a package for generating OSV-style JSON vulnerability entries
  from a `report.Report`
* `client` contains a client for accessing HTTP/fs based vulnerability
  databases, as well as a minimal caching implementation
* `cmd/gendb` provides a tool for converting TOML reports into JSON database
* `cmd/genhtml` provides a tool for converting TOML reports into a HTML website
* `cmd/linter` provides a tool for linting individual reports
* `cmd/report2cve` provides a tool for converting TOML reports into JSON CVEs
