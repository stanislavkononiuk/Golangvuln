Vulnerability #1: GO-2020-0040
  Due to unchecked type assertions, maliciously crafted messages
  can cause panics, which may be used as a denial of service
  vector.

  Call stacks in your code:
      .../main.go:16:14: example.com/manystacks.main calls github.com/shiyanhui/dht.New
      .../main.go:30:28: example.com/manystacks.main$2 calls example.com/manystacks/otherpkg.GetPeers, which eventually calls github.com/shiyanhui/dht.DHT.GetPeers
      .../main.go:44:7: example.com/manystacks.main calls github.com/shiyanhui/dht.DHT.Run

  Found in: github.com/shiyanhui/dht@v0.0.0-20201219151056-5a20f3199263
